paperClip extracts tweets via Twitter API and processes the textual data through the VADAR Sentiment Analysis machine learning package by Python. 

Each word within the tweets are categorised as positive, neutral & negative, resulting in a net sentiment score for the overall content. 

If you wish to use this model, please pull the repo to your local machine, ensure the above dependencies are installed and run the application on your local server. 

You can then search any subject you wish via the search bar on the Landing Page, which will render a dashboard providing analysis on your subject. 

LIMITATIONS - VADAR modelling is unable to 100% confirm emotiveness, in particular, it is prone to sarcasm, different languages & regional dielects.
